Copyright (c) [DATE], [YOUR NAME]

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided also that you do the following:

    a) The above copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Work and must be accompanied by the [LINK TO THE OFFICIAL WORK].
    
    b) Any work that includes a portion of this Work must be licensed under the same license.
    
    c) The final product that uses any portion of the original code licensed under this license cannot be patented.
    
    d) The final product that uses any portion of the original code licensed under this license must be open source.

3. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED to copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

4. THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.
