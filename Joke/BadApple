            The work <name> of <author> is under BadApple 1.0
  Any individual is free to use excerpts from the code, but anywhere
  in the code that the individual used, will have to have an part,
  a frame, a piece of audio from the song "Bad Apple" from Lotus Land Story.

  If someone modifies the original code (which came from the source), the
  project of the person who modified becomes a "rotten apple", which will
  spoil the whole bag of apples (the projects/derivative codes).

  You can use the original code, but you cannot modify the stretch you used
  from the original code.
