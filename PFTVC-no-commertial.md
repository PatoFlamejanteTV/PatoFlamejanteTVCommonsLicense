# PatoFlamejanteTV's Commons License
The **PatoFlamejanteTV's Commons License** is a free, _copyleft_ license for software and other kinds of works.

**When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.** To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, **if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.** You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
## 1. Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution and Modification

**“This License”** refers to version No-Comertial of PatoFlamejanteTV's Commons License

**“Copyright”** also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

**“The Program”** refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

**To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work** in a fashion requiring copyright permission, **other than the making of an exact copy.** The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

**A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.**

**To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.** Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

**To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.** Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

- **You may copy, distribute and modify the content as long as you attribute the original work to author and maintain the original intentions of the project** (_i.e._, not removing it from its context for purposes such as sensationalist materials or _reposting_ in your own accont or _website_).

- **You must notify the author every time the name of the work, the code, or any asset is used.**

- **Any derivative work must also be shared under the same license** and include the "PFTVC.md" or the "LICENSE.md"/"LICENSING.md" file in the root (_i.e._, ./LICENSE.md, ./LICENSE.txt)

- **This license DOES NOT permit commercial use of the content.** If you have any questions about your rights under this license, please contact the author.

# 2. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
